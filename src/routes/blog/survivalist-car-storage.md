One of the BEST and easiest ways to be prepared for ANYTHING (I’m talking SHTF) and minor everyday inconveniences is to properly prepare\.\.\. YOUR CAR!

Now it does not matter what type of car you drive. Every car has some lost spaces that you can utilize for your prep. The absolute best space is actually behind seats! I have one of these organizers behind ever single seat in my van. I have had these for years and I could not be happier with them. They are sturdy, clean up well, and have saved the day more than once (stocked full of mints for car sick children).

Another great space to utilize is the space between seats! Totally wasted space! This is what we use to add so much storage to that area.

We have this between the drivers and passengers seats so we only put items we need to access quickly here.

One overlooked item in most cars is actually a trash can. Adding a system to take care of trash quickly is essential to keeping your car clean and organized. You don’t want to put all this work into keeping your car stocked with supplies and organized only to have it become a cluttered mess. We keep our van clean and organized by always throwing trash out immediately. TRUST ME. This is a game changer.

My FAVORITE place to organize is the trunk. We have several of these and they are ALWAYS in our trunk. You can leave them empty and keep your groceries safe on the way home from the store. We have one stocked at all times with our favorite supplies.

And lastly\.\.\.what are we keeping stocked in our car??? Here’s our extensive list. We have several kids that get car sickness easily, we have many young kids, and we live in a moderate climate so all that changes what we store. Make adjustments for your area and lifestyle.
