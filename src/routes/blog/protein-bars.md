Protein Bars.

No prepper’s pantry is complete without these convenient, calorie dense, protein-filled instant snacks. They are great to have on a busy day or when you really want something sweet but don’t want to indulge in something completely void of nutrients. And in case of an emergency I think they are the perfect food: they require no heating or preparation, make for an extremely quick snack, and they usually have a pretty good nutrition profile. 

When it comes to choosing a particular type of protein bar, there are a dizzying array of brands available. Some are better tasting than others, others have a better texture, and still others have a particular focus such as extra protein or cleaner ingredients. 

To help you with picking the perfect option for your particular needs, I’m giving you a list of all my favorites and telling you why you should add them to your pantry.

# Pure Protein
## Most Budget Friendly 
<AmazonComponent title="Pure Protein Variety Pack" company="Pure Protein" href="https://amzn.to/3r1GmXT" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41pDNVuo5sL.jpg"/>

Pure protein is absolutely delicious, and definitely tastes like a treat - yet each bar gives you about 20 grams of protein. There are a pretty wide variety of flavors, and these are one of the most cost-effective bars you can buy to fill up your emergency supply. Even if protein bars aren’t your thing, I recommend adding a box or two of these to your emergency food, just in case.

# KIND Protein Bars
## Nut Lover’s Choice
<AmazonComponent title="Kind Protein Bar Variety Pack" company="KIND" href="https://amzn.to/3iWYJJ4" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eatzqDdrL._SL1500_.jpg"/>

If you love a good nutty bar, then these are for you. They are filling, taste great, and provide about 12 grams of protein per bar.

# RX Bar
## Simple Ingredients 
<AmazonComponent title="RX Bar Variety Pack" company="Healthiest Bars" href="https://amzn.to/3j7vqDr" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UbGFTrnhL._SL1450_.jpg"/>

These are great for people with allergies or special diets, because they have very simple and clean ingredients.

# Lara Bar
## Healthy Option
<AmazonComponent title="Lara Bar Variety Pack" company="Sanisco" href="https://amzn.to/3j0YDjK" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Qg-3wYPUL._SL1500_.jpg"/>

Lara bars are a personal favorite of mine, but despite the healthy ingredients and great flavor, the somewhat gritty texture can be a turn-off to some. If you have certain ingredients you are trying to avoid but still want a convenient and delicious protein bar option, then these might be one to check out.

# Quest Bar
## Low Sugar
<AmazonComponent title="Quest Bar Variety Pack" company="Quest Nutrition" href="https://amzn.to/3K7RqKy" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81+5lvGAp-L._AC_SL1500_.jpg"/>

I keep these around for when I’m craving dessert. These totally feel like a guilty pleasure, but have only about 1 gram of sugar while being packed with 20 grams of protein per bar. And with really unique flavors like Birthday Cake, Maple Waffle, and Cookies & Cream - you can find the particular flavor for you.

Quest also has cookies, candy, and even chips if you are on a low-sugar / high-protein diet.

# Barebells
## Delicious 
<AmazonComponent title="Barebells Protein Variety Pack" company="Barebells" href="https://amzn.to/3udoFXr" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HF+Q4lt+L._SL1500_.jpg"/>

Barebells are without a doubt the best tasting protein bars out there. You will feel like you’re eating a candy bar, but there is no added sugar and about 20 grams of protein per bar.

# ONE
## Best Flavor Options
<AmazonComponent title="ONE Protein Bar Variety Pack" company="ONE Brands" href="https://amzn.to/3J9WoF3" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71j-+qwx4iL._AC_SL1400_.jpg"/>

While there are options with better macros, these are great for finding your favorite flavors. With options like Glazed Doughnuts, Churro, and Blueberry Cobbler, everyone can find a bar they like.

As a final world of advice: all of these bars have a great shelf life, but make sure you check expiration dates and rotate your pantry so that you’re consuming the oldest products first.
