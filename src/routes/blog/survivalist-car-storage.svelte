<p class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the BEST and easiest ways to be prepared for ANYTHING (I’m taking SHTF and minor everyday inconveniences is to properly prepare….YOUR CAR! </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it does not matter what type of car you drive. Every car has some lost spaces that you can utilize for your prep. The absolute best space is actually behind seats! I have one of these organizers behind ever single seat in my van (insert car organizer and photo from amazon). I have had these for years and I could not be happier with them. They are sturdy, clean up well, and have saved the day more than once (stocked full of mints for car sick children). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another great space to utilize is the space between seats! Totally wasted space! This is what we use to add so much storage to that area ( insert link and amazon picture). We have this between the drivers and passengers seats so we only put items we need to access quickly here. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One overlooked item in most cars is actually a trash can. Adding a system to take care of trash quickly is essential to keeping your car clean and organized. You don’t want to put all this work into keeping your car stocked with supplies and organized only to have it become &nbsp;a cluttered mess. We keep our van clean and organized by always throwing trash out immediately. TRUST ME. This is a game changer. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c2">My FAVORITE place to organize is the trunk. We have several of these (insert product and picture) and they are ALWAYS in our trunk. You can leave them empty and keep your groceries safe on the way home from the store. We have one stocked at al times with our favorite supplies. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c2">And finally….what are we keeping stocked in our car??? Here’s our extensive list. We have several kids that get car sickness easily, we have many young kids, and we live in a moderate climate so all that affects what we store. Make adjustments for your area and lifestyle. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><ul class="c4 lst-kix_mz21oqoffjz-0 start"><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Mint (link)</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Ginger chews (link) </span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Snacks and breakfast bars (make sure you dont keep anything with items like chocolate that will melt in your car, heres what we keep in our car) (link) </span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Paper towels</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Beach towels</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Alcohol wipes</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Sanitizer </span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Sea sickness bands (link)</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Tissue</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Sunglasses (link) </span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Change purse with loose change &nbsp;(link)</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">&nbsp; Umbrella</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Car vacuum </span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Chargers for every device</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Ice scraper</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Gloves</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Fan with mister (link)</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Maps of surrounding areas</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Essential oil rollers (link)</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Rain coats</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Change of clothes (very important for infants and toddlers)</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Diapers and wipes</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Pocket knife (link)</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Hand warmers (link) </span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Kids travel toys (link) </span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Kids travel books (link) </span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Sun screen </span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Bug spray</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Stun gun</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Lip balm</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Body wipes</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">The BEST roadside emergency kit (link)</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">The BEST first aid kit (link) </span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Rain coats (link)</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Garbage bags &nbsp; </span></li></ul>
