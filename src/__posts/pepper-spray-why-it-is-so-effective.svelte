<p>When it comes to non lethal self defense weapons pepper spray is right up there at the top of popularity for two main reasons: ease of use and effectiveness.</p><p><b>How It Works</b></p><p>Pepper spray uses Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) which comes from cayenne pepper. Defensive pepper sprays are measured in Scoville Heat Units (SHU's) a common measure of a products' "hotness". A jalapeno pepper has an SHU of 5000, a habanero pepper 300,000 and a typical pepper spray will be in the 2 million SHU range.</p><p>A one second spray in the face with a 10 % solution of a pepper spray will get you 20-30 minutes away from an attacker. It will cause the attacker to have shortness of breathe, have temporary blindness due to excessive tearing and the eyes actually shutting down, coughing and choking. He will scream from the pain.</p><p>You will survive a potential attack and no permanent damage will be done to the attacker. A well aimed shot from a pepper spray has outstanding stopping power. That is why it has become one of the most effective women's self defense items and crime prevention tools.</p><p>Most pepper sprays have an effective range of 6-12 feet. A new gel pepper spray works up to 18 feet. Most models use a fine grain stream. Foam and fogger products are available for those who are unsure of their aiming abilities.</p><p>I have seen pepper sprays that can be disguised as pens, pagers, lipstick, and even hand held walking weights. Almost all models are small enough for a purse or to attach on a key chain. Some have velcro straps to attach to just about anything or a clip to hook onto a belt.</p><p><b>Who Uses Pepper Sprays</b></p><p>If you think crime can only happen to the other guy you are wrong. The "other guy" is thinking the same thing and <b>YOU</b> are that "other guy". There is a reason why they call it self defense. You have to protect yourself.</p><p>A violent crime occurs every 19 seconds and an assault every 29 seconds. For would be victims of a robbery, assault, theft, rape, murder, or kidnapping an investment of $15- $25 for a pepper spray is certainly worth the peace of mind and sense of security it provides. No one is safe from the crimes of today be it a personal assault or a home break in.</p><p>Women are particularly vulnerable, especially those who work late at night, those in sales positions, real estate agents, and those who live alone. They in particular need self defense products such as an effective OC pepper spray.</p><p><b>Please Note</b> that even though pepper spray is legal in all 50 states, some states and cities have restrictions. Check with your local police department. Literally thousands of police departments carry and use pepper spray. Why wouldn't you?</p>
